# Getting Started with a Scalar Adder

This demo is the *hello world* of the FPGA workflow using Vitis, Vivado, and PYNQ. Specifically, we will build a toy *accelerator*, a scalar adder that adds two numbers.  The accelerator will run in the FPGA.   Obviously, this function is so simple there is no reason to use an FPGA.  However the process introduces the essential steps for hardware/software co-design and gives you a reproducible starting point for more advanced projects.

By completing this demo, you will learn how to:

* Design and synthesize a simple **Vitis IP** that performs a basic mathematical operation using an **AXI-Lite interface**
* Create a minimal **Vivado project** that integrates the IP
* Synthesize the design to generate a **bitstream**
* Build a **PYNQ overlay** that loads the bitstream onto the FPGA board
* Interact with the IP from **Python**, using a simple AXI-Lite transaction sequence

This demo is designed to be modular, reproducible, and beginner-friendlyâ€”perfect for building intuition before diving into DMA, interrupts, or vectorized designs.

## Pre-Requirements
Prior to doing this demo, you will need to select an Ubuntu machine as the host computer, and follow the [installation instructions](../docs/installation.md) to install Vitis and Vivado and connect the FPGA board to the host computer.

Then select a directory on the host computer and clone the repository to that directory. 

## Building the Vitis IP and Vivado Project

The demo is conducted in two steps:

* [Design the Vitis IP and FPGA project](./docs/fpga_build.md) where we design the IP in Vitis, integrate into the FPGA and create the Overlay
* Run the [jupyter notebook demo]() that illustrates how to access the Overlay from python.

You can directly skip the first step since we have uploaded the files for the Overlay in the git repo.
