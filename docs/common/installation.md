# Installing Vivado and Vitis for RFSoC 4x2

These instructions are for installing Vivado and Vitis on an **Ubuntu machine** for use with the [RFSoC 4x2 board](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/university-program/aup-boards/rfsoc4x2.html). While many demos in this repo are broadly applicable across FPGA platforms, several focus on **real-time wireless communications processing** using RFSoC. If you're using a different board, you'll need to adjust the steps accordingly.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Version Compatibility

You **cannot use the latest version** of Vivado/Vitis. You must install a version that matches a valid **Board Support Package (BSP)** for your board.

- Visit the [Real Digital GitHub page](https://github.com/RealDigitalOrg/RFSoC4x2-BSP)
- Look for files like `RFSoC4x2_2024_1.bsp` ‚Üí this means you should install **Vivado/Vitis 2024.1**
