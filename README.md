# FPGA Demo
This is a repository I am creating for a sequence of demos to illustrate how to build various designs for FPGA along with Python-based test benches.  While some of the material is general, I am focused on FPGA applications for real-time communications. Currently, the target board is the amazing [Xilinx / AMD RFSoC 4x2](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/university-program/aup-boards/rfsoc4x2.html), but most of the demos should apply generally.
