# Scalar Adder

This demo is the *hello world* of the FPGA workflow using Vitis, Vivado, and PYNQ. It introduces the essential steps for hardware/software co-design and gives you a reproducible starting point for more advanced projects.

By completing this demo, you will learn how to:

- Install and configure **Vitis** and **Vivado**
- Design and synthesize a simple **Vitis IP** that performs a basic mathematical operation using an **AXI-Lite interface**
- Create a minimal **Vivado project** that integrates the IP
- Synthesize the design to generate a **bitstream**
- Build a **PYNQ overlay** that loads the bitstream onto the FPGA board
- Interact with the IP from **Python**, using a simple AXI-Lite transaction sequence

This demo is designed to be modular, reproducible, and beginner-friendlyâ€”perfect for building intuition before diving into DMA, interrupts, or vectorized designs.
